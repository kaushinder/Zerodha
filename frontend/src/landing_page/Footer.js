          Dear Investor, if you are subscribing to an IPO, there is no need to
          issue a cheque. Please write the Bank account number and sign the IPO
          application form to authorize your bank to make payment in case of
          allotment. In case of non allotment the funds will remain in your bank
          account. As a business we don't give stock tips, and have not
          authorized anyone to trade on behalf of others. If you find anyone
